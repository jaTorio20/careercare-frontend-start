# CareerCare Frontend

CareerCare Frontend is a React application that provides an intuitive interface for job seekers to analyze resumes, generate cover letters, track job applications, and practice interviews with AI assistance.

## Migration: TanStack Router (https://github.com/jaTorio20/CareerCare-AI-Dashboard-Frontend) → TanStack Start (https://github.com/jaTorio20/careercare-frontend-start)

This project was **migrated from TanStack Router (SPA) to TanStack Start** to unlock powerful server-side capabilities:

### Why We Migrated

| Feature | TanStack Router (Before) | TanStack Start (After) |
|---------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| **Rendering** | Client-side only (SPA) | Server-Side Rendering (SSR) |
| **SEO** | Limited (requires workarounds) | Full SEO support with meta tags |
| **Initial Load** | Slower (JS must load first) | Faster (HTML rendered on server) |
| **Head Management** | Client-side only | Server-rendered `<head>` content |
| **API Routes** | Separate backend needed | Built-in server functions |

### Key Changes Made

1. **Root Layout** (`src/routes/__root.tsx`):
   - Added `shellComponent` for HTML document structure
   - Added `HeadContent` and `Scripts` for SSR hydration
   - SEO meta tags rendered server-side

2. **Router Configuration** (`src/router.tsx`):
   - Updated to support SSR with QueryClient context
   - Added proper type registration for TanStack Start

3. **Dependencies**:
   - Added `@tanstack/react-start` for SSR framework
   - Added `nitro` for server runtime
   - Kept all existing dependencies (TanStack Query, Axios, TipTap, etc.)

4. **Build Configuration** (`vite.config.ts`):
   - Uses `tanstackStart()` plugin instead of `TanStackRouterVite()`
   - Added `nitro()` plugin for server builds

### SEO Benefits

Each route can now define its own `head()` function for page-specific SEO:

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute('/')({
  head: () => ({
    title: 'CareerCare - AI Job Application & Resume Dashboard',
    meta: [
      {
        name: 'description',
        content: 'AI-powered resume analysis, cover letter generation, and interview practice.',
      },
    ],
  }),
  component: HomePage,
})
```

## What This Application Does

CareerCare is an all-in-one career assistance platform that helps users:

- **Resume Analysis**: Upload resumes and get AI-powered feedback including ATS scores, keyword matching, and improvement suggestions
- **Cover Letter Generation**: Create personalized cover letters using AI, with a rich text editor for customization
- **Job Application Tracking**: Organize and track job applications with status updates, notes, and resume attachments
- **AI Interview Practice**: Practice interviews with real-time speech-to-text transcription and AI-generated questions and responses

## How It Works

### Architecture Overview

The frontend is built with React 19 and TypeScript, using modern React patterns:

- **TanStack Router** (`src/routes/`): File-based routing system for navigation
- **TanStack Query** (`src/api/` and `src/features/`): Data fetching, caching, and state management
- **Components** (`src/components/`): Reusable UI components organized by feature
- **Context** (`src/context/`): Global state management (authentication, theme)
- **Services** (`src/lib/`): Axios configuration, authentication helpers

### Main Features Breakdown

#### 1. Resume Analysis (`src/routes/resumes/`)
- **Upload Page**: Users upload a PDF or Word resume file and provide a job description
- **Analysis Process**: 
  - File is uploaded to the backend
  - Analysis job is created and queued
  - Frontend polls for results using TanStack Query
  - Results display includes ATS score, keyword analysis, and improvement suggestions
- **Results View**: Visual feedback with color-coded scores and actionable recommendations
- **Save Functionality**: Users can save analyzed resumes to their account

#### 2. Cover Letter Generation (`src/routes/cover-letter/`)
- **Generation Form**: Users input job details (title, company, description) and optional personal details

- **Create/Edit Forms**: Add new applications with company info, job details, status, location, salary range, and notes
- **File Attachments**: Upload and attach resume files (stored in Cloudinary)
- **Status Management**: Track application status (applied, interviewing, offer, rejected, etc.)
- **Search & Filter**: Find applications by company name or job title

#### 4. Interview Practice (`src/routes/interview/`)
- **Session Management**: 
  - Create interview sessions with job title, company, topic, and difficulty
  - Sidebar shows all sessions with labels
- **Chat Interface**:
  - Text-based conversation with AI interviewer
  - Audio recording support with real-time transcription
  - Audio files are recorded, converted to WAV format, and uploaded to Backblaze B2
- **Audio Player** (`src/components/Interview/WaveformAudioPlayer.tsx`):
  - Visual waveform display
  - Playback controls with time tracking
  - Shows current time, duration, and progress bar
- **AI Responses**: Google Gemini AI provides context-aware interview questions and feedback based on conversation history

#### 5. Authentication (`src/routes/auth/` and `src/context/`)
- **Login/Register**: Traditional email and password authentication
- **Google OAuth**: Social login with Google accounts
- **Token Management**: 
  - Access tokens stored in localStorage
  - Automatic token refresh via Axios interceptors (`src/lib/axios.ts`)
  - Protected routes redirect to login if unauthenticated

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- Backend API server running (see backend README)

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

This should match your backend server URL.

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by Vite).

### Production Build

1. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Preview the production build:
```bash
npm run serve
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment.

## Application Flow

### User Journey

1. **Landing/Home** (`src/routes/index.tsx`):
   - Welcome page with feature overview
   - Quick links to main features
   - Call-to-action buttons

2. **Authentication**:
   - New users register or login with Google
   - Session persists across page refreshes
   - Protected routes require authentication

3. **Resume Analysis**:
   - Upload resume → Provide job description → View analysis results → Save if needed

4. **Cover Letter**:
   - Generate letter → Edit in rich text editor → Save → View/Edit later → Export

5. **Job Applications**:
   - Create application card → Fill details → Attach resume → Track status updates

6. **Interview Practice**:
   - Create session → Start conversation → Send text or record audio → Receive AI feedback → Review history

### Data Flow

- **API Calls**: All API requests go through Axios instance configured in `src/lib/axios.ts`
- **State Management**: 
  - Server state: TanStack Query handles fetching, caching, and mutations
  - Client state: React hooks (useState, useRef) for local UI state
  - Global state: Context API for user authentication
- **Routing**: TanStack Router handles navigation with type-safe params and search params

## Key Components

- **Header** (`src/components/Header.tsx`): Main navigation with user menu and logout
- **ProtectedRoute** (`src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`): Wrapper component that checks authentication
- **AudioRecorder** (`src/components/Interview/AudioRecorder.tsx`): Records audio with pause/resume and progress tracking
- **WaveformAudioPlayer** (`src/components/Interview/WaveformAudioPlayer.tsx`): Plays audio with visual waveform and time controls
- **CoverLetterEditor** (`src/components/cover-letter/CoverLetterEditor.tsx`): Rich text editor with formatting toolbar

## Styling

The application uses TailwindCSS for styling:
- Utility classes for layout, colors, spacing
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Custom color palette (indigo primary, gray neutrals)
- Consistent component styling patterns

## Error Handling

- API errors are caught by TanStack Query and displayed via toast notifications
- Form validation errors show inline messages
- Network errors are handled gracefully with retry mechanisms
- 401 errors trigger automatic token refresh

## Performance Optimizations

- Code splitting via Vite's dynamic imports
- Image optimization for uploaded files
- Query caching reduces unnecessary API calls
- Optimistic updates for better UX (interviews, applications)
- Lazy loading for route components

## Browser Support

Modern browsers with support for:
- ES6+ JavaScript features
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Audio recording API (for interview feature)
- LocalStorage (for token storage)
